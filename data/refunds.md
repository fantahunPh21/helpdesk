# Refund Policy

## When can I request a refund?

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all new customers. If you're not satisfied with our service within the first 30 days, you can request a full refund.

## How do I request a refund?

To request a refund, contact our support team at support@helpdesk.ai with your account details and reason for the refund. We'll process your request within 5 business days.

## What if I've been a customer for more than 30 days?

After the initial 30-day period, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact our support team to discuss your situation. We may offer service credits or plan adjustments instead of refunds.

## Are there any non-refundable items?

Custom development work, training sessions, and professional services are generally non-refundable. However, we're happy to discuss alternatives if you're unsatisfied.

## What about annual plans?

Annual plans are eligible for refunds within the first 30 days. After that period, we offer a 50% credit toward future services if you cancel within the first year.

## How long does a refund take?

Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after approval. The time it takes to appear in your account depends on your bank or payment processor.
